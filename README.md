# InternHub

InternHub is a console-based project that connects students looking for internships with
project managers from various companies. Every user, either student or project manager has to
login or register first. The students can surf through the internships available and apply for the
internships they are interested in. Project managers post about openings for interns and select
candidates based on their skills.
